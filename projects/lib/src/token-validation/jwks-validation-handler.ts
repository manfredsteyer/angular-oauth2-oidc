Beginning with angular-oauth2-oidc version 9, the JwksValidationHandler
has been moved to an library of its own. If you need it for implementing
OAuth2/OIDC **implicit flow**, please install it using npm:

  npm i angular-oauth2-oidc-jwks --save

After that, you can import it into your application:

  import { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc-jwks';

Please note, that this dependency is not needed for the **code flow**,
which is nowadays the **recommended** one for single page applications.
This also results in smaller bundle sizes.
