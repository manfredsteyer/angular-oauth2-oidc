# Refreshing a Token 

The strategy to use for refreshing your token differs between implicit flow and code flow. Hence, you find here one separate section for both of them.

The last section shows how to automate refreshing for both flows.

## Refreshing when using Code Flow (not Implicit Flow!)

> For refreshing a token with implicit flow, please see section below!

When using code flow, you can get an ``refresh_token``. While the original standard DOES NOT allow this for SPAs, the mentioned document proposes to ease this limitation. However, it specifies a list of requirements one should take care about before using refresh_tokens. Please make sure you respect those requirements.

Please also note, that you have to request the ``offline_access`` scope to get an refresh token.

To refresh your token, just call the ``refresh`` method:

```typescript
this.oauthService.refresh();
```


## Refreshing when using Implicit Flow (not Code Flow!)

To refresh your tokens when using implicit flow you can use a silent refresh. This is a well-known solution that compensates the fact that implicit flow does not allow for issuing a refresh token. It uses a hidden iframe to get another token from the auth server. When the user is there still logged in (by using a cookie) it will respond without user interaction and provide new tokens.

To use this approach, setup a redirect uri for the silent refresh.

For this, you can set the property silentRefreshRedirectUri in the config object:

```TypeScript
// This api will come in the next version

import { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';

export const authConfig: AuthConfig = {

  // Url of the Identity Provider
  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',

  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',

  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user after silent refresh
  silentRefreshRedirectUri: window.location.origin + '/silent-refresh.html',

  // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server
  clientId: 'spa-demo',

  // set the scope for the permissions the client should request
  // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one
  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',
}
```

As an alternative, you can set the same property directly with the OAuthService:

```TypeScript
this.oauthService.silentRefreshRedirectUri = window.location.origin + "/silent-refresh.html";
```

Please keep in mind that this uri has to be configured at the auth-server too.

This file is loaded into the hidden iframe after getting new tokens. Its only task is to send the received tokens to the main application:

```HTML
<html>
<body>
    <script>
    parent.postMessage(location.hash, location.origin);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Please make sure that this file is copied to your output directory by your build task. When using the CLI you can define it as an asset for this. For this, you have to add the following line to the file ``.angular-cli.json``:

```JSON
"assets": [
    [...],
    "silent-refresh.html"
],
```

To perform a silent refresh, just call the following method:

```TypeScript
this
    .oauthService
    .silentRefresh()
    .then(info => console.debug('refresh ok', info))
    .catch(err => console.error('refresh error', err));
```

When there is an error in the iframe that prevents the communication with the main application, silentRefresh will give you a timeout. To configure the timespan for this, you can set the property ``silentRefreshTimeout`` (msec). The default value is 20.000 (20 seconds).

### Automatically refreshing a token when/ before it expires (Code Flow and Implicit Flow)


To automatically refresh a token when/ some time before it expires, just call the following method after configuring the OAuthService:

```TypeScript
this.oauthService.setupAutomaticSilentRefresh();
```

By default, this event is fired after 75% of the token's life time is over. You can adjust this factor by setting the property ``timeoutFactor`` to a value between 0 and 1. For instance, 0.5 means, that the event is fired after half of the life time is over and 0.33 triggers the event after a third.
