Otherwise, the validation of the user profile will fail!\nBy default, sessionStorage is used. To use localStorage call method setStorage\nDemands using https as OIDC and OAuth2 relay on it. This rule can be relaxed using the property requireHttps, e. g. for local testing.\nDemands that every url provided by the discovery document starts with the issuer's url. This can be relaxed by using the property strictDiscoveryDocumentValidation.\n\nSample-Auth-Server\nYou can use the OIDC-Sample-Server mentioned in the samples for Testing. It assumes, that your Web-App runns on http://localhost:8080.\nUsername/Password: max/geheim\nclientIds: \n\nspa-demo (implicit flow)\ndemo-resource-owner (resource owner password flow)\n\nredirectUris:\n\nlocalhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]\nlocalhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]/index.html\nlocalhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]/silent-refresh.html\n\nInstalling\nnpm i angular-oauth2-oidc --saveImporting the NgModule\nimport { OAuthModule } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n[...]\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [ \n    [...]\n    HttpModule,\n    OAuthModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent,\n    HomeComponent,\n    [...]\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [\n    AppComponent \n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\nConfiguring for Implicit Flow\nThis section shows how to implement login leveraging implicit flow. This is the OAuth2/OIDC flow best suitable for\nSingle Page Application. It sends the user to the Identity Provider's login page. After logging in, the SPA gets tokens.\nThis also allows for single sign on as well as single sign off.\nTo configure the library the following sample uses the new configuration API introduced with Version 2.1.\nHence, The original API is still supported.\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\n\n  // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n  // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n}Configure the OAuthService with this config object when the application starts up:\nimport { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\nimport { authConfig } from './auth.config';\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'flight-app',\n    templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n      this.configureWithNewConfigApi();\n    }\n\n    private configureWithNewConfigApi() {\n      this.oauthService.configure(authConfig);\n      this.oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();\n      this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();\n    }\n}Implementing a Login Form\nAfter you've configured the library, you just have to call initImplicitFlow to login using OAuth2/ OIDC.\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\n@Component({\n    templateUrl: \"app/home.html\"\n})\nexport class HomeComponent {\n\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n    }\n\n    public login() {\n        this.oauthService.initImplicitFlow();\n    }\n\n    public logoff() {\n        this.oauthService.logOut();\n    }\n\n    public get name() {\n        let claims = this.oauthService.getIdentityClaims();\n        if (!claims) return null;\n        return claims.given_name;\n    }\n\n}The following snippet contains the template for the login page:\n\n    Hallo\n\n\n    Hallo, {{name}}\n\n\n\n    Login\n\n\n    Logout\n\n\n\n    Username/Passwort zum Testen: max/geheim\nSkipping the Login Form\nIf you don't want to display a login form that tells the user that they are redirected to the identity server, you can use the convenince function this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndLogin(); instead of this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin(); when setting up the library. \nThis directly redirects the user to the identity server if there are no valid tokens. \nCalling a Web API with an Access Token\nPass this Header to the used method of the Http-Service within an Instance of the class Headers:\nvar headers = new Headers({\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + this.oauthService.getAccessToken()\n});If you are using the new HttpClient, use the class HttpHeaders instead:\nvar headers = new HttpHeaders({\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + this.oauthService.getAccessToken()\n});Since 3.1 you can also automate this task by switching sendAccessToken on and by setting allowedUrls to an array with prefixes for the respective urls. Use lower case for the prefixes.\nOAuthModule.forRoot({\n    resourceServer: {\n        allowedUrls: ['http://www.angular.at/api'],\n        sendAccessToken: true\n    }\n})Routing\nIf you use the PathLocationStragegy (which is on by default) and have a general catch-all-route (path: '**') you should be fine. Otherwise look up the section Routing with the HashStrategy in the documation.\nMore Documentation\nSee the documentation for more information about this library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
