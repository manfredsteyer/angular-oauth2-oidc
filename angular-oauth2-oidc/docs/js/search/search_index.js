At server side we've used IdentityServer (.NET/ .NET Core) and Redhat's Keycloak (Java).\nNew Features in Version 3.0\nSee Release Notes\nNew Features in Version 2.1\n\nNew Config API (the original one is still supported)\nNew convenience methods in OAuthService to streamline default tasks:\nsetupAutomaticSilentRefresh()\nloadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin()\n\n\nSingle Sign out through Session Status Change Notification according to the OpenID Connect Session Management specs. This means, you can be notified when the user logs out using at the login provider.\nPossibility to define the ValidationHandler, the Config as well as the OAuthStorage via DI\nBetter structured documentation\n\nNew Features in Version 2\n\nToken Refresh for Implicit Flow by implementing \"silent refresh\"\nValidating the signature of the received id_token\nProviding Events via the observable events.\nThe event token_expires can be used togehter with a silent refresh to automatically refresh a token when/ before it expires (see also property timeoutFactor).\n\nAdditional Features\n\nLogging in via OAuth2 and OpenId Connect (OIDC) Implicit Flow (where user is redirected to Identity Provider)\n\"Logging in\" via Password Flow (where user enters his/her password into the client)\nToken Refresh for Password Flow by using a Refresh Token\nAutomatically refreshing a token when/ some time before it expires\nQuerying Userinfo Endpoint\nQuerying Discovery Document to ease configuration\nValidating claims of the id_token regarding the specs\nHook for further custom validations\nSingle-Sign-Out by redirecting to the auth-server's logout-endpoint\n\nBreaking Changes in Version 2\n\nThe property oidc defaults to true.\nIf you are just using oauth2, you have to set oidc to false. Otherwise, the validation of the user profile will fail!\nBy default, sessionStorage is used. To use localStorage call method setStorage\nDemands using https as OIDC and OAuth2 relay on it. This rule can be relaxed using the property requireHttps, e. g. for local testing.\nDemands that every url provided by the discovery document starts with the issuer's url. This can be relaxed by using the property strictDiscoveryDocumentValidation.\n\nSample-Auth-Server\nYou can use the OIDC-Sample-Server mentioned in the samples for Testing. It assumes, that your Web-App runns on http://localhost:8080.\nUsername/Password: max/geheim\nclientIds: \n\nspa-demo (implicit flow)\ndemo-resource-owner (resource owner password flow)\n\nredirectUris:\n\nlocalhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]\nlocalhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]/index.html\nlocalhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]/silent-refresh.html\n\nInstalling\nnpm i angular-oauth2-oidc --saveImporting the NgModule\nimport { OAuthModule } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n[...]\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [ \n    [...]\n    HttpModule,\n    OAuthModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent,\n    HomeComponent,\n    [...]\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [\n    AppComponent \n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Configuring for Implicit Flow\nThis section shows how to implement login leveraging implicit flow. This is the OAuth2/OIDC flow best suitable for\nSingle Page Application. It sends the user to the Identity Provider's login page. After logging in, the SPA gets tokens.\nThis also allows for single sign on as well as single sign off.\nTo configure the library the following sample uses the new configuration API introduced with Version 2.1.\nHence, The original API is still supported.\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\n\n  // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n  // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n}Configure the OAuthService with this config object when the application starts up:\nimport { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\nimport { authConfig } from './auth.config';\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'flight-app',\n    templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n      this.configureWithNewConfigApi();\n    }\n\n    private configureWithNewConfigApi() {\n      this.oauthService.configure(authConfig);\n      this.oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();\n      this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();\n    }\n}Implementing a Login Form\nAfter you've configured the library, you just have to call initImplicitFlow to login using OAuth2/ OIDC.\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\n@Component({\n    templateUrl: \"app/home.html\"\n})\nexport class HomeComponent {\n\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n    }\n\n    public login() {\n        this.oauthService.initImplicitFlow();\n    }\n\n    public logoff() {\n        this.oauthService.logOut();\n    }\n\n    public get name() {\n        let claims = this.oAuthService.getIdentityClaims();\n        if (!claims) return null;\n        return claims.given_name;\n    }\n\n}The following snippet contains the template for the login page:\n\n    Hallo\n\n\n    Hallo, {{name}}\n\n\n\n    Login\n\n\n    Logout\n\n\n\n    Username/Passwort zum Testen: max/geheim\nSkipping the login form\nIf you don't want to display a login form that tells the user that they are redirected to the identity server, you can use the convenince function this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndLogin(); instead of this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin(); when setting up the library. \nThis directly redirects the user to the identity server if there are no valid tokens. \nCalling a Web API with an Access Token\nPass this Header to the used method of the Http-Service within an Instance of the class Headers:\nvar headers = new Headers({\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + this.oauthService.getAccessToken()\n});If you are using the new HttpClient, use the class HttpHeaders instead:\nvar headers = new HttpHeaders({\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + this.oauthService.getAccessToken()\n});Some infos about Routing\nMore Documentation\nSee the documentation for more information about this library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\nOverview\n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\ndependencies\n\nLegend\n\n  Declarations\n\n  Module\n\n  Bootstrap\n\n  Providers\n\n  Exports\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                    Zoom in\n                    Reset\n                    Zoom out\n                \n            \n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            1 module\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        2 injectables\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        16 classes\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        5 interfaces\n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Manfred Steyer\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This is a well-known solution that compensates the fact that implicit flow does not allow for issuing a refresh token. It uses a hidden iframe to get another token from the auth-server. When the user is there still logged in (by using a cookie) it will respond without user interaction and provide new tokens.\nTo use this approach, setup a redirect uri for the silent refresh.\nFor this, you can set the property silentRefreshRedirectUri in the config object:\n// This api will come in the next version\n\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user after silent refresh\n  silentRefreshRedirectUri: window.location.origin + '/silent-refresh.html',\n\n  // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\n\n  // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n  // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n}As an alternative, you can set the same property directly with the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.silentRefreshRedirectUri = window.location.origin + \"/silent-refresh.html\";Please keep in mind that this uri has to be configured at the auth-server too.\nThis file is loaded into the hidden iframe after getting new tokens. Its only task is to send the received tokens to the main application:\n\n\n    \n    parent.postMessage(location.hash, location.origin);\n    \n\nPlease make sure that this file is copied to your output directory by your build task. When using the CLI you can define it as an asset for this. For this, you have to add the following line to the file .angular-cli.json:\n\"assets\": [\n    [...],\n    \"silent-refresh.html\"\n],To perform a silent refresh, just call the following method:\nthis\n    .oauthService\n    .silentRefresh()\n    .then(info => console.debug('refresh ok', info))\n    .catch(err => console.error('refresh error', err));When there is an error in the iframe that prevents the communication with the main application, silentRefresh will give you a timeout. To configure the timespan for this, you can set the property siletRefreshTimeout (msec). The default value is 20.000 (20 seconds).\nAutomatically refreshing a token when/ before it expires\nTo automatically refresh a token when/ some time before it expires, just call the following method after configuring the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.setupAutomaticSilentRefresh();By default, this event is fired after 75% of the token's life time is over. You can adjust this factor by setting the property timeoutFactor to a value between 0 and 1. For instance, 0.5 means, that the event is fired after half of the life time is over and 0.33 triggers the event after a third.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/working-with-httpinterceptors.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/working-with-httpinterceptors.html","title":"additional-page - Working with HttpInterceptors","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterceptors\nSince 3.1 the library uses a default HttpInterceptor that takes care about transmitting the access_token to the resource server and about error handling for security related errors (HTTP status codes 401 and 403) received from the resource server. To put in on, just set sendAccessToken to true and set allowedUrls to an array with prefixes for the respective urls. Use lower case for the prefixes:\nOAuthModule.forRoot({\n    resourceServer: {\n        allowedUrls: ['http://www.angular.at/api'],\n        sendAccessToken: true\n    }\n})You can provide an error handler for the urls white listed here by provding a service for the token OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler.\nTo implement such a service, implement the abstract class OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler. The following example shows the default implemantion that just passes the cought error through:\nexport class OAuthNoopResourceServerErrorHandler implements OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler {\n\n    handleError(err: HttpResponse): Observable {\n        return _throw(err);\n    }\n\n}Custom Interceptors\nFeel free to write custom interceptors but keep in mind that injecting the OAuthService into them creates a circular dependency which leads to an error.
